# bitfield-functor
# Summary

Embedded programing proof of concept: bitfields with functors

 My motivations for conducting this exercise was to experiment with using functors for twiddling bits in a GPIO register. I haven't noticed anyone doing this and I was just interested in seeing how this approach would work out.
# Extended Commentary
Normally hiding bit-twiddling would just mean abstracting such code into one or more functions.  This time I wanted to abstract such code into functors instead of functions.  At the call site both functions and functors would appear indistinguishable from each other.

In addition, this time I wanted to use bit-fields instead of the "raw bits" approach (i.e., bitwise ANDing,ORing and so on.)  NB: I've always understood bit-fields perfectly well, it's just that everyone else almost always chose to go with the "raw bits" technique.  That said, I've always considered  bit-fields to be a more natural looking way to twiddle bits in a register.

 So, in short, I had the following objectives:

1. I wanted to work with functors
2. I wanted to work with partial template specialization
3. I wanted to try using bit-fields instead of the "raw bits" technique
4. I wanted to discover how much extra code is required to go the generic programming template route.

## The two applications for this template/bitfield scheme
 There are two scenarios I wanted to cover in this exercise:

1. functors for a GPIO register that is part of a custom design (e.g., a custom controller board);  and
2. functors for the registers of an off-the-shelf IC (e.g., NEED_IC_ID)
## Regarding the template for the GPIO register
The irony of using a template to operate on a GPIO register hardwired to a custom design can be summed up in two points:

1. The point of templates is to facilitate generic programming;
2. I cannot conceive of a way to abstract bitfield usage in such a way that one template can accomodate all designs for using a GPIO register.

Put another way, the highly hardware implementation specific concerns of register bit-twiddling defeats generic programming's intent of code reuse.  Consequently, the template code for something like a GPIO register will be a one-off, unreusable code.
